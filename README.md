# LPW_FIT-NIRS
 FT-NIRS Modelling w/ LPW & IBM P Cod Otoliths

.rmd detailing my work with juvenile Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus) daily aging models with FT-NIRS otolith scan data. Includes:
- details for importing FT-NIRS scans of otoliths from Bruker MPA II and Opus software (.0 files)
- pre-processing methods for spectral data
Will additionally include:
- variable (wavelength) selection
- various multivariate modelling approaches (PLS, PCR, MLR)
- model selection (AIC? AICc??)

Spectral data included in LPW_scans folder
